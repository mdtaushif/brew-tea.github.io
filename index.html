    <h2>Tea Garden in assam</h2>
    <div class="tea_garden"><img src="./IMAGES/TEA GARDEN.jpg"  alt="" /></div>
    <p>
      Assam tea is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour.The state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region by production, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and very close to China. This part of India experiences high rainfall; during the monsoon period, as much as 250 to 300 mm (10 to 12 in) of rain per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 36 °C (96.8 °F), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known.

    <h2>Hand plucking</h2>
    <div class="handplucking"><img src="./IMAGES/HAND PLUCKING.jpg" alt="" class="hand_plucking"></div>
    <p class="content">Machine harvesting can damage the leaves too much before processing.Older leaves have a stronger flavor, so our plantations focus only on getting the top two leaves and buds from each plant for fine flavored teas.We know that this techenique is not affective and takes a lot of time and costlier.But for you tea enthusiast out there we would comprimise on that and bring the finest grind you can possibly get in the market</p>
    <h2>Drying</h2>
    <img src="./IMAGES/TEA PROCESSING.jpg" class="teap" alt="">
    <p>
      First excess moisture is removed from tea leaves, this process is called withering. The leaves are laid out on a wire mesh and left to dry for 18-20 hours. ... Afterwards tea is dried so that it can preserve its quality during long-term storage: tea is put into a drying chamber with very hot air and then is rapidly cooled.  
    </p>
    <h2>END-PRODUCT</h2>
    <img src="./IMAGES/end prod.jpg" alt="" class="END_PRODUCT">
    <p>
      we sun dry our leaves and make sure you get the natural hit.This makes our tea supply dependant on the nature so we have <b><i>limited supplies</i></b> . Grab your brew fast so that you are able to get the premium and fully natural taste before it goes out of stock <b>which it will <i>for sure</i></b>.
